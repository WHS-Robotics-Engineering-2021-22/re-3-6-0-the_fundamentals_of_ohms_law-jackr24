The circtuit has a Vd of 3.32 and an I of 3.32 mA = 0.00332 A
V/I=R 5/0.0032A = 1506 R
1506- the 1,000 resistor is 506.
There was more voltage drop on the LED. This is because there is a little more resistance on it. It went from 3.32 to 1.68
The resistance value is now 1,160 meaning this is a less powerful LED and the total voltage is a little more.
